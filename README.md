# Computer-aided-lung-cancer-diagnosis-using-Explainable-AI
This project is a computer-aided diagnosis system for lung cancer that uses deep learning and explainable AI (XAI) to classify lung tissue images. The system is deployed as a Flask web server and can be accessed through a mobile application, providing a practical tool for early detection and interpretation of lung cancer.
